// Creates this service's SCHEMA if it does not exist. Nothing else.
//
//   railway run node scripts/ensureDatabase.js --dry-run
//   railway run node scripts/ensureDatabase.js --confirm
//
// Topology: ONE MySQL instance, ONE SCHEMA PER SERVICE. Each service owns its
// own schema and never touches another's — see docs/DATABASE.md.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT BOOT BEHAVIOUR.
//
// Creating the schema automatically at startup would turn a TYPO into a silent
// disaster: point DB_NAME at `cocarr_iamm`, and instead of failing loudly the
// service would create an empty schema, sync a full set of tables into it and
// come up perfectly healthy with no data. Every list is empty, nothing errors,
// and the real database is sitting untouched next to it. That is a far worse
// outcome than a refusal, and it is close to what already happened once.
//
// So creating a schema is always a deliberate act with `--confirm`.
//
// ...EXCEPT IN `--bootstrap`, WHICH IS THE SAME ACT MADE SAFE TO AUTOMATE.
//
// The manual gate exists to stop ONE thing: a typo in DB_NAME silently creating
// an empty schema beside the real data. That risk disappears if the name is not
// a free variable — so `--bootstrap` creates the schema only when DB_NAME
// matches the name PINNED IN THIS REPO (package.json → config.expectedDbName),
// and only where the environment has opted in with ALLOW_SCHEMA_BOOTSTRAP=true.
// A typo then fails loudly instead of creating a decoy, which is exactly what
// `--confirm` was protecting.
//
// WHY IT IS NEEDED AT ALL. The MySQL service creates exactly one schema on a
// fresh volume — whatever MYSQL_DATABASE names (here: `cocarr_iam`). Every other
// service's schema was created by hand and is declared nowhere, so a volume
// reset, a restored backup, or a brand-new environment comes up missing them.
// That is not hypothetical: `cocarr_workspace` disappeared exactly this way, and
// the deploy could not recover on its own.
//
// IT IS OPT-IN PER ENVIRONMENT, and that is the point. In an environment holding
// real data, a missing schema means something has gone badly wrong and the
// deploy SHOULD stop — silently recreating it empty and letting migrations
// rebuild the tables would produce a healthy-looking service with no data, and
// nobody would notice until they went looking for a row. Set
// ALLOW_SCHEMA_BOOTSTRAP=true on environments that are meant to be rebuildable
// from nothing; leave it unset where losing the schema is an incident.
//
// SAFETY
// - CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS only. It never drops, never alters, and does
//   nothing at all when the schema is already there.
// - It creates NO TABLES. Run the schema step afterwards (this service:
//   `npm run migrate:up`).
// - It prints the other schemas on the instance first. If your data is sitting
//   in one of them under a different name, the fix is to correct DB_NAME —
//   NOT to create a new empty schema beside it.
